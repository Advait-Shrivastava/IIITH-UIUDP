# CampusLink

This app offers a convenient solution by enabling students to quickly determine if any event conflicts with their scheduled lectures. By implementing this feature, students receive updates solely for the events that are relevant to them, eliminating the clutter of irrelevant notifications. This approach ensures that students stay well-informed about the events that matter, optimizing their overall experience.
